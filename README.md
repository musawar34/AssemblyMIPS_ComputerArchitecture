# Assembly MIPS (Computer Architecture)

## üìö Introduction

My name is **Stefano Caramagno**, and I'm pleased to present this repository containing exercises on **computer architecture** implemented in **Assembly MIPS programming**. <br>
These exercises were completed as part of the **Computer Architecture** course during my **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering** at the **University of Catania**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **C to MIPS Translation**: Converts C programs into Assembly MIPS to illustrate low-level execution. 
- **Instruction Optimization**: Improves performance by reducing instruction count and optimizing memory access. 
- **Control Structures**: Implements loops and conditional statements in Assembly MIPS.  
- **Function Calls & Stack**: Manages function calls, recursion, and stack frames.  
- **Memory Management**: Works with arrays, pointers, and direct memory access. 
- **Arithmetic & Logic**: Performs integer and floating-point calculations, bitwise logic, and branching. 
- **System Calls & I/O**: Uses MIPS system calls for input and output operations.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Programming Language**: Assembly MIPS for implementing low-level programming.  
- **Development Environment**:  ILPSim for writing and simulating Assembly MIPS code.
- **Version Control**: Git for tracking changes and managing project versions.   
- **Repository Hosting**: GitHub for storing, sharing, and maintaining the project repository.  

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system before proceeding:

- **ILPSim**: Version 1.8 or later, required to simulate Assembly MIPS programs.
- **Java Runtime Environment (JRE)**: Required to run ILPSim.  
- **Git**: Used to clone the repository.

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**  

   To download the repository and navigate to its directory:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/stefanocaramagno/AssemblyMIPS_ComputerArchitecture.git
   cd AssemblyMIPS_ComputerArchitecture
   ```

2. **Run ILPSim**

   To launch ILPSim present in the current directory:

   ```sh
   java -jar ILPSim_v1.8.jar
   ```

3. **Open the Programs**

   Open a specific program (e.g., exercise_01.s) in ILPSim.

### Running the Simulation

1. **Run the Simulation**

   Execute the simulation process and display results.
