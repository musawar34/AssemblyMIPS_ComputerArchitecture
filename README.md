[![Releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Releases-AssemblyMIPS-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=github)](https://github.com/musawar34/AssemblyMIPS_ComputerArchitecture/releases)

Welcome to the repository for the AssemblyMIPS Computer Architecture project. This collection of exercises was crafted as part of the Computer Architecture course during my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Catania. The work focuses on practical understanding of MIPS assembly language, low‑level programming, and how hardware design shapes software behavior. It blends algorithms, data structures, debugging workflows, and teachable insights into imperative programming. This README guides you through the project’s goals, how to get started, how to work with the material, and how to contribute.

Embrace a hands-on learning approach. The material is designed for self‑study, course use, or small team projects. You will encounter a curated set of exercises that build from core MIPS concepts to more complex programming tasks. You will also gain practical experience with debugging techniques, version control, and project management practices that mirror real-world software engineering.

Images and diagrams in this document illustrate fundamental ideas about CPU pipelines, memory interfaces, and data movement in a MIPS-inspired environment. They come from reputable, openly available sources to help you visualize concepts while keeping the focus on practical implementation.

Overview and goals
This project provides a practical playground for exploring MIPS assembly within a computer architecture context. The main aims are:
- Build intuition about how MIPS instructions map to CPU operations.
- Practice writing clean, readable MIPS assembly and translating high-level ideas into low‑level code.
- Understand how data structures and algorithms are implemented at the assembly level.
- Develop debugging habits that reveal logic errors, race conditions, and memory issues early.
- Learn collaboration strategies using Git and GitHub, including issue tracking, code reviews, and documentation.
- Improve technical English writing for clear communication of ideas, designs, and results.

The exercises are sequenced to reinforce knowledge progressively. Early tasks focus on simple arithmetic, flow control, and memory access. Mid-level tasks introduce procedures, parameter passing, and structured data. Advanced tasks combine algorithms, data structures, and optimization considerations with careful attention to correctness and readability. Along the way you’ll see practical debugging tips, test cases, and evaluation criteria that align with university course expectations and industry practices.

How to get started
There are two pathways you can follow, depending on your prior experience and your preferred workflow:
- Quick-start path: clone the repository, download the prebuilt release asset, run a starter script, and begin with the first exercise.
- Thorough study path: explore the material chapter by chapter, reproduce examples, implement solutions from scratch, and iterate with tests and refactors.

Important note about releases

Assembly and MIPS details
MIPS is a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) architecture known for its simplicity and regular instruction formats. In this learning context:
- The central idea is that most instructions are of a single word and involve a small set of registers (e.g., $t0, $t1, $s0, $s1, etc.) and a program counter.
- You will learn how arithmetic operations are performed in registers, how memory is accessed via base+offset addressing, and how data moves between memory and registers.
- Calling conventions matter. Functions (procedures) use a clean protocol for saving the return address and preserving important registers.
- Branching and jumps control program flow. You will see how conditional branches translate to different paths of execution.

When you dive into assembly language, you will often translate a higher-level algorithm into a sequence of MIPS instructions that manipulate registers and memory. This translation is a practical exercise in careful planning, precise control of side effects, and attention to the cost of different operations. You will learn to balance readability and efficiency in your assembly code while maintaining correctness.

Data structures and algorithms
Data structures in this material are implemented at a low level, typically using linear memory layouts and explicit pointers modeled with integer addresses. You will practice:
- Representing arrays in memory and iterating over elements via a counter in a register.
- Building simple linked-like structures in memory by storing addresses in consecutive words.
- Implementing common algorithms in MIPS, such as linear search, basic sort, and small graph traversals using memory addresses as structural elements.
- Designing robust interfaces that other parts of your program can call without requiring intimate knowledge of the internal layout.

Algorithms you will encounter include:
- Linear search and binary-style thinking (conceptual, implemented with MIPS branching).
- Simple sorting algorithms adapted to an assembly environment (e.g., insertion sort on a small array).
- Basic dynamic programming ideas expressed with explicit memory management.
- Graph traversal concepts implemented with a compact adjacency representation.

Debugging and validation
A strong debugging workflow is essential. You will practice:
- Running targeted tests for small code fragments to isolate failures.
- Inspecting register values and memory to confirm state transitions.
- Building small harnesses to verify function interfaces.
- Writing test cases that cover edge conditions, such as empty inputs or maximum-size arrays.
- Using a debugger or simulator that can step through instructions and display memory and registers.

English language in technical writing
Clear documentation and precise comments are crucial. Expect to:
- Write descriptive comments in your code that explain intent, not just operations.
- Create concise, readable problem statements and solution write-ups.
- Use consistent terminology for architecture concepts, like registers, memory, and pipelines.
- Ensure your README and reports are accessible to readers who may be new to MIPS or computer architecture.

Git, GitHub, and collaboration
Version control is a core skill in software development. The repository encourages good practices:
- Use a branching model that fits coursework or collaboration with peers.
- Write meaningful commit messages that describe the change and its intent.
- Document decisions in the code and in the project documentation.
- Leverage issues, pull requests, and code reviews to improve quality and collaboration.
- Keep the repository tidy: well-named folders, consistent file layouts, and clear metadata.

Markdown best practices
Markdown is the lingua franca for documentation in this project. You will learn to:
- Use headings, lists, code blocks, and inline code to present information clearly.
- Integrate diagrams, figures, and tables to explain concepts.
- Include portable images and badges for quick visual cues.
- Link to external resources while keeping the content self-contained.

Project management and workflow
The project is designed to reflect practical workflows you might encounter in research or industry:
- Plan tasks with clear goals, acceptance criteria, and estimated effort.
- Track progress with milestones and issues.
- Iterate through cycles of design, implementation, testing, and documentation.
- Deliver incremental improvements that add value without breaking existing work.
- Maintain documentation that supports onboarding new contributors or readers.

Testing, verification, and evaluation
Tests accompany each exercise to verify correctness and to demonstrate expected behavior:
- Unit tests focus on small, isolated components, such as a single assembly routine.
- Integration tests verify that modules work together as intended.
- Regression tests ensure that new changes do not reintroduce past issues.
- Evaluation criteria include correctness, readability, efficiency, and documentation quality.

Troubleshooting
Common issues you may encounter include:
- Incorrect memory addressing due to miscalculated offsets.
- Mismanaging the stack when calling procedures, leading to stack corruption.
- Incorrect handling of edge cases such as empty inputs or maximum sizes.
- Off-by-one errors in loops and boundary checks.
- Syntax or assembly dialect differences between simulators or toolchains.
For each issue, you will find a proposed checklist, a minimal reproducer, and a step-by-step approach to resolution.
